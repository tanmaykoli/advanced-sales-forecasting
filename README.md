# Advanced Sales Forecasting 📈

This project demonstrates an advanced time series forecasting workflow using a realistic sales dataset. It focuses on understanding sales patterns through visualization, decomposition, and statistical analysis to support data-driven decision making.

## 📊 Project Overview
Sales forecasting is essential for planning inventory, managing resources, and identifying business trends. This notebook explores historical sales data to uncover trends, seasonality, and patterns using time series analysis techniques.

## ✨ Features
- Realistic synthetic sales dataset
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Time series visualization
- Trend and seasonal decomposition
- Stationarity testing
- Forecasting using statistical models
- Visual interpretation of results

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Files Included
- `Advanced_Sales_Forecasting.ipynb` — Notebook containing full analysis workflow
- `sales_data.csv` — Dataset used in the project

## 📈 Key Insights
- Identifies underlying sales trends over time
