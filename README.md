- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Time series visualization
- Trend and seasonality decomposition
- Stationarity testing
- Forecasting model implementation
- Clear visual outputs

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Files Included
- `Advanced_Sales_Forecasting.ipynb` — Main notebook with full workflow
- `sales_data.csv` — Dataset used for analysis

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels
3.Open the notebook in Jupyter
4.Run cells sequentially
